# UFOs

### Project Overview
The object of this project was to build a UFO sightings website using `Javascript`, `Bootstrap`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.

### Results
The webpage **UFO Sightings - The Truth is Out There** was created to allow curious visitors the ability to access information following a possible encounter.

    <img width="90%" src="https://github.com/molivajimenez22/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/website.png">
    
      The blue squares highlight the following fields:
      1. Navigation section
      2. Page header
      3. Description summary and table displaying all information 
      4. Search filters
 
The site comes with "place holder" data in the filter section to show visitors an example of what to enter. However, the visitor can then go in and type their information as shown below.

 ### Summary
 
 While the website contains a lot of great information, it also has its limitations. For instance, I needed to enter the exact shape for bonita and I noticed that it's case sensitive. There's no detail letting the visitor know of this. 
 
 My recommendation is to include a dropdown list. It'd also be great the website pulled data from an active database so that it has the nmost up to date information.
